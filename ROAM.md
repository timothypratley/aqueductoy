# Problem:

Discovering truth


# Users:

Productivity centered professionals. What they've done is their intellectual property. Things that go into company Jira don't follow the person.

Greater than average degree of experimentation.

Bottom up: mention things and structure emerges.

Writers / news reporters / scientists : people who want to discover truth

What's our demographic? % of users who are scientists etc?

# Perception

Basic bullet point word document that they open in a browser where they can reference bullets. Use/mention distinction.


# Good thinking

* Collective knowledge management, peer review
* Accrete unstructured thoughts and rapidly navigate them
  - top down models always fail
* Quick access
* Atomic, unstructured thoughts, collect structure out of them
* Writing stuff down, and reconciling it with other things you've written


# Unsolved problems in ROAM

* Optimized for writing, but not for reading
* Searching by circumstance
